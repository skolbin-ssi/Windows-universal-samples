                Lock screen apps are apps that can notify users when the users are not using their device.
                Lock screen apps have the ability to show updates to the user
                on the lock screen by updating badge counts and glyphs, showing toast notifications, or by allowing a text-only
                version of their Start tile to appear on the lock screen.
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap" Margin="0,10,0,0">
                An app must set the appropriate information in the manifest in order to appear on the lock screen. In the Visual Studio 
                manifest editor, under the Lock screen notifications option in the Application UI tab, set the value to either 
                "Badge" or "Badge and Tile Text". For apps deployed to Windows 10 versions less than 1709 (16299), the app must
                also specify a background task of type "Control channel", "Timer", or "Push notification" in the Declarations tab.
                For more information, see the "Background Tasks" sample.
            </TextBlock>
            <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap" Margin="0,10,0,0">
                Check that your application was configured so that is can show
                lockscreen notification in the app-specific settings page.
                To appear on the lock screen, the user must add it manually
                through the Lockscreen personalization page in Settings.
                When declared in the manifest as described above, the app will
                appear in the list of allowable lock screen apps.
                (If the app doesn't appear, then exit the Settings app,
                and then click &quot;Go to Lockscreen Settings&quot; again.)
